1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,770
OK, so we're going to get started on our FAA cue project, so I just have my project starter, but

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,360
I also have a link to the font awesome CD.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:15,230
And so you can, you know, grab this from the repository or from font, awesome dot com or from CBSNews.com.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:25,020
And then for the title here, let's say F a Q and then in the body we're going to have an H1 and say

5
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,930
frequently asked questions and write under the one we're going to have a container.

6
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,160
Let's call this fake new dash container.

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,340
And inside here we're going to have our fake new device.

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,690
And whichever ones are showing the answer, we'll have a class of active.

9
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,000
OK, so I'm only going to put active on the first one for now.

10
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,630
And you can have more than one active at the same time.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,510
It's not like they're the expanding, you know, the expanding tabs that we did or expanding cards,

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:02,860
whatever.

13
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,540
So in here in the queue, we're going to have a title.

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:18,510
So each three dot F.A.A. Q Dash title, let's say, why shouldn't we trust atoms?

15
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,630
And then we're going to have a paragraph of the class of fake Q Dasch text.

16
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,320
And this will basically be the answer.

17
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,070
We'll say they make up everything.

18
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,920
So these are just like stupid little jokes.

19
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,040
Of course you can change it to whatever you like.

20
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,510
Then we want our button.

21
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,360
Now we're going to have either a Chevron, either Chevron down button.

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,400
If it's retracted and if it's expanded, we'll have an X button or times button.

23
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,110
So let's do an eye tag here.

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,970
So fast font.

25
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,480
Awesome.

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,230
Efate dash, Chevron dash down.

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,740
And under that we're going to have an FAA dash times, which is an X.

28
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,830
OK, so if I save this, it's going to look like that.

29
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,680
Now we're going to have three more of these or four total.

30
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,420
So I'm just going to paste these in.

31
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,840
I'm going to go still within the container, but right under the first fake hair and paste these in

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,650
and save.

33
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,130
And I can see we just have actually we have five total.

34
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,700
OK, so I mean you can grab these if you don't want to just copy them from here, you can grab them

35
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,220
from the final repository.

36
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:32,880
All right.

37
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,770
But basically they're just an F a Q with a title text and the two buttons.

38
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,990
So now it's jumping to the stylesheet.

39
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,460
And as far as the font goes, I'm going to use the Mully font.

40
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:51,480
So I'm going to say success, questionmark family and set that equal to Muli.

41
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,300
And then let's in the body set that font

42
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,710
and we could do this like display flex to center and all that.

43
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,500
But I'm going to just center it directly on the container.

44
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,140
So I'm just going to add a background color here of F zero three times, which is like gray.

45
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:20,430
And then for the H1, let's set a margin will do 50 pixels, top zero and then 30 pixels.

46
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:26,970
And I want to text line that to the center and then let's center the container.

47
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:32,160
So remember, we have a Q dash container

48
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:46,580
and for that let's set a max width of 600 pixels and to keep it in the middle, because right now can

49
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,800
see it stuck to the edge.

50
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,870
You want to keep it in the middle.

51
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:55,590
So we'll set a margin zero for top and bottom and auto on the left and right, which is going to keep

52
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,480
it in the middle of that six hundred pixels.

53
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:58,660
All right.

54
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,660
So for each F a Q, we want to add some styles.

55
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,410
So let's add a background color of transparent.

56
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,660
Basically, the active one is going to have a white background, but the ones that are active are going

57
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,680
to be transparent.

58
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,910
And let's set the border to one pixel solid.

59
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:26,220
And for the color, we're going to use nine F A for a eight, gives it a border.

60
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,670
Also going to add a border radius of ten pixels, make the corners a little rounded margin.

61
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,930
Let's do twenty pixels on the top and bottom there on the left and right.

62
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,750
That will separate them out then for padding.

63
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:40,500
Oops.

64
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,690
For padding.

65
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:49,770
Let's do thirty pixels all the way around and I'm going to position this relative so that we can position

66
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:58,370
stuff absolute within the Q and let's add an overflow of hidden so that nothing comes out of the container.

67
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,790
Also we want to.

68
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:10,460
Transition when we open and close or expand and collapse, so let's add a transition and just to zero

69
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,020
point three seconds each.

70
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,310
So basically anything that's that that can transition will in this amount of time.

71
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,900
Now for the FAA cue that's active, let's say FAA cue.

72
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:29,600
If it has a class of active, then I want to set a background color of white and the first one is active.

73
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,950
So it's background color of why.

74
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:38,090
I also want to give it a background icon or actually to background icons positioned in a certain way.

75
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:46,460
Now we know how to put font awesome icons in directly in the HTML with specific classes we can also

76
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,210
insert them with.

77
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:56,330
So if you've never done this before, if we go to font awesome dotcom and we search for an icon, I

78
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,410
won't comment.

79
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:07,540
And let's check out this right, and actually this this one right here comment, so if you notice,

80
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,590
it gives you the class so we can directly insert it in the H2O.

81
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,070
We also get this Unicode value of F zero seven five.

82
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,900
Every icon has a different value.

83
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,170
So we can actually use this to insert an icon using success.

84
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:30,580
So I want to have actually two of these common icons as a background here on active.

85
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,340
Well, one thing I did forget is the box shadow, which I'm just going to paste in.

86
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:42,490
So it's just two shadows with zero on the horizontal offset, three on the vertical, six blur, and

87
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,160
then this is the color and then a second shadow.

88
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,240
So just so it looks like it's coming off the page a little bit.

89
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:57,430
But back to the to the icons where I'm going to add the CSFs for this is on the before and after pseudo

90
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,630
selector for fake active.

91
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:07,840
So if I had to say colon colon before I can pass in a content value here and I can put anything I want,

92
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,050
like.

93
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,540
Hello.

94
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,210
So before this fake U active you can see it's inserting Halo.

95
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,620
I can also use after.

96
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:22,680
So I'm going to also say f a Q active after and now you can see Halo after it.

97
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:31,120
Now instead of using text here for content, we're going to put in that Unicode character.

98
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:37,030
Now when you use font awesome like this and you put in the Unicode, you want to use backslash and then

99
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,240
whatever the code is, which in our case is F zero seven five.

100
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:47,110
Now, if I just save that, we're just going to see this square because we need to include the font

101
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,420
family for font.

102
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:49,930
Awesome.

103
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,410
Which is actually going to be font space.

104
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,350
Awesome space five space free.

105
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,010
And now if I save that, you can see that I've inserted those two icons.

106
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,450
Now we obviously want to style this.

107
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:12,260
Let's go ahead and add a color here of hexadecimal to E, C, C, seven one.

108
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,960
OK, gives it that green color.

109
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:24,360
Let's set the font size and let's put that to seven REM units, which makes it much bigger.

110
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:34,130
So it's basically seven times whatever the root HTML element font size is, which initially is sixteen

111
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,780
pixels.

112
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,780
So in addition to that we want to position oops, what the heck is that.

113
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,990
We want to position absolute

114
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,770
and let's set.

115
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,420
I don't want them to be so dark.

116
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,340
So let's set the opacity here to we'll do zero point two.

117
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:01,480
That's going to make them much lighter and for the position let's say from the top will do twenty pixels.

118
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,090
Remember this is for both before and after.

119
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,730
So what we're doing now is positioning, positioning them both in the same place, but then we'll grab

120
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,800
one of them and move it a little bit.

121
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,110
So top twenty pixels left twenty pixels.

122
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:22,210
And if I save that it looks like there's only one, but they're actually both just in the same exact

123
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:22,900
position.

124
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:30,880
And I want to set a Z index of zero so that we make sure that it's behind everything else.

125
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,570
Now like I said, they're both in the same position.

126
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,820
So what I'll do is take the one that's before.

127
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:44,920
So I'm just going to grab this class for this selector and I'm going to change the color of it to let's

128
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,390
do three, four, nine, eight DB.

129
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:55,150
So give it a blue color and then let's set the position top.

130
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,850
So remember, it's already positioned to absolute right here.

131
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,510
So we don't have to add that here, but we want to change these coordinates.

132
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,930
So from the top, let's say negative ten pixels.

133
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:13,450
So it's going to move it up negative ten pixels from, you know, from the initial zero and then left.

134
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,360
Let's do negative thirty pixels.

135
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,260
So now I'll save that and you can see that that's been moved.

136
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:28,510
Another thing that I want to do is rotate it, because right now the little point is over here off the

137
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:28,870
screen.

138
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:33,850
I want to basically turn it around so we can use transform translate for that.

139
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,550
So let's say transform and not translate.

140
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,990
I'm sorry, rotate, because we want to rotate this on the Y axis.

141
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,890
So it's going to be rotate y and let's rotate it halfway.

142
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,990
So 180 degrees.

143
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,370
And now if I save, you can see that this blue one has been rotated.

144
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,990
Now we could have just as well used the comments icon this one.

145
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,170
Right.

146
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:04,930
Air, which looks very similar, and we could have just just done before and added it, but this makes

147
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:10,990
it a little more interesting using using, you know, multiple icons and just positioning them differently

148
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,550
so you could do whatever you want as a background here or in anything that you create.

149
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,650
So now what I want to do is the title and the text here.

150
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:29,040
So let's go down here and say a dash title or F a Q sorry for the title.

151
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:34,060
All I want to do is add margin, say zero top 35

152
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,390
35 right.

153
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,340
Zero bottom zero left.

154
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:47,620
And for the text say fake you dash text for this.

155
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,680
We're going to I'm just going to add a margin here of thirty pixels zero zero.

156
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:59,230
But I don't want this to show unless it's unless it has the active class.

157
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,110
So let's initially set this to display none.

158
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,980
And now we can't see any of the text, any of the answers.

159
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:17,580
However, if it's active, so fake, active and f a Q dash text, then we want to display as a block.

160
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,430
So now we can only see the answer for the one that is active.

161
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:29,260
OK, if I were to add active on another one like this one here, if I add that class of active that's

162
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,090
going to give it all those properties and it's going to show the question I'm sorry, the answer as

163
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:34,440
well.

164
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,780
Now I'm going to stop here and in the next video, we're going to handle these buttons because we only

165
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,030
want the X to show if it's active.

166
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,800
We only want the Chevron to show if it's not, we also need to style them and then we'll add a little

167
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,180
bit of JavaScript to be able to click and expand each F you.

00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,350
All right, so Dribble Dotcom is actually a great place to get inspiration for projects.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,170
This is a dribble by effort by James called Fake Hugh.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,610
And you can see it's basically just these cards that you can expand that have questions and answers.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,900
So this is what we're going to create based off that dribble.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,110
And we're going to use quite a bit of success because we're going to use font.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:22,590
Awesome.

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,240
But we're not going to just put these these common icons right in the HTML.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,020
We're going to use UCSC using the specific Unicode for these fonts, for these icons, and then we're

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,050
going to position them and then we'll add the JavaScript so that we can close and open each of these

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,640
tabs to see the answer.

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:49,350
OK, so the CSFs will probably take up most of our time and then the JavaScript is pretty easy.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,890
We just need to toggle the act of class basically on the parent node.

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:53,700
So that's it.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,860
Let's go ahead and get into it.
